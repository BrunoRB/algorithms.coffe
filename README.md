## Because there is no life without coffee
Classic algorithms and data structures in coffeescript.

## Getting Started
### Users
#### NodeJS
To use the library on a NodeJS project just install it with npm:

Globally:
```shell
npm -g install algorithms.coffee
```

Locally:
```shell
npm install algorithms.coffee
```

And use the require to use the functions.

Example:
```shell
var myVariable = require('algorithms.coffee');
var sortedArray = myVariable.insertionSort([3, 1, 2]);
```

#### Browser JS
To use the library in standard client-side JavaScript just download the minified file and use it as any other .js file.
```shell
./dist/algorithms.coffee.min.js
```

### Contributors

We encourage everybody to contribute with this library. Just try and implement any classic algorithm in CoffeeScript.
You need to have NodeJS 0.10 or higher and NPM installed.
